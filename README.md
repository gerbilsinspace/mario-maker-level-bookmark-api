# Mario Maker Level Bookmarking API

## Dependencies

* Postgres
* Python 3

## To use:

* Copy the settings.example.py file to settings.py.Start tweaking values until you are happy.
This includes database connection information.
* run using `python3 manage.py runserver`

There is probably the usual installation of dependencies, and stuff, too.
You'll also need to migrate the data to the database. After that, and the server is running,
you should be able to start the react app, and connect the two together.
